            You open your design program of choice and there it is staring back
            at <br />
            you, a blank canvas. It can be a little intimidating. Where do you
            start? <br />
            Where do you put the headline? Where do you add images and <br />
            illustrations? A grid is just what you need to get started.

          <p id="para2">
            A grid is a system for organizing the content of a design, they
            create <br />
            alignment and order. Whether you‚Äôre creating a layout for print like
            a <br />
            magazine or combining images and text to design a landing page, you
            <br />
            will use a grid to help you make design decisions and create a good
            <br />
            experience for the user. Take a look at how this landing page design
            <br />
            breaks down its elements across a 12-column grid.

          Using a grid eliminates random decision-making. Instead of placing

          elements in random places, by using a grid properly you‚Äôll know
          exactly <br />
          where to place elements like a logo, menu items, a headline, body copy
          <br />images, and more. It will also help speed up your design

          In the 20th century, designers like Jan Tschichold and Josef M√ºller-
          <br />
          Brockmann developed new grid systems that became what we know <br />
          today as
          <a href="">The Swiss-Style or The International Typographic Style.</a>
          They
          <br />

          Grids help give shape and hierarchy to web design. Without them, you
          <br />
          would have no idea where to place your design elements. We need them
          <br />
          to create a good user experience so a user knows how to navigate
          <br />
          through a website and find what they need.

          Grids also help when it comes to responsive design. While the desktop
          <br />
          experience of a landing page might use multiple columns to span text
          <br />
          and images across, the design needs to be flexible enough to condense
          <br />
          down well to 2‚Äì3 columns on a table and 1 column on a mobile device.
          <br />
          Notice how the mobile grid becomes stacked like a 1 column modular
          grid <br />
          in this example. ‚Äç

        <h1 id="blog-head" style="color: #5928e5">Types Of Grid</h1>
        <p id="blog-content">
          There are 5 main types of grids. Some are better than others for web
          <br />
          design, but you have likely used all 5 at one point in your design
          career.

          A baseline grid is a bit more technical, it‚Äôs defined by where the
          text sits. <br />
          Essentially, it‚Äôs the leading or spacing between the baselines. This
          grid <br />
          helps to create a good experience for the reader, especially where
          there <br />
          is a lot of text to read. While it‚Äôs most important for print design
          like book <br />
          layouts, it‚Äôs also critical to consider the baseline grid in web
          design. Think <br />
          about how the spacing between your lines impacts the legibility of a
          <br />
          landing page. If the text is too tight, a user may give up and leave
          your <br />
          site completely. Create a good balance of text and white space. ‚Äç

          A manuscript grid is the foundation for all books, newspapers, and
          <br />
          magazines. Also known as a single-column grid, it‚Äôs one of the
          simplest <br />
          grid structures and is good for large continuous blocks of text and
          images. <br />
          Basically, it‚Äôs a large rectangle area inside the page, like a
          bounding box for the text.

          Column grids help break up text, photos, and illustrations. For
          websites, <br />
          you can have anywhere from 2‚Äì12 or even 16 columns that span the width
          <br />
          of a landing page. You can place text and images within just one
          column or <br />
          they can span across multiple columns.The space between columns is
          <br />
          called the gutters, they should be the same size across all. ‚Äç

          Not all column grids have to be symmetrical. For example, you can
          utilize <br />
          an asymmetric column grid where some are thinner while others are
          <br />
          wider which can be useful depending on the hierarchy of your design.
          <br />
          Asymmetrical column grids are commonly used on blog websites where
          <br />
          you have the main content in the larger two-thirds container of the
          layout, <br />
          while the smaller third may be a sidebar that includes information
          about <br />
          the blog and the writer. Take a look at how this blog homepage uses an
          <br />
          asymmetrical column grid.

          Modular grids are similar to column grids but differ with the addition
          of <br />
          rows. You‚Äôll find newspapers and magazines use modular grids quite a
          bit <br />
          to organize content but they can also be used on a website or app
          <br />
          design, such as in a product grid section.

          The YouTube homepage is another example of a modular grid in use.
          <br />
          While they utilize a sidebar on the left for common links like the
          trending <br />
          and subscriptions section, all video content is organized into a 4
          column <br />
          modular grid to maximize how many videos a user can browse while

          scrolling for something to watch. ‚Äç

          After you have done your research, maybe even explored some low-

          fidelity wireframing on paper, create a grid for your landing page.
          It‚Äôs one <br />
          simple step, once you‚Äôve created it, you won‚Äôt have to think about it
          again <br />
          for all subsequent landing pages. Before you start designing, think
          about <br />
          the grid first, rather than leaving it to the end and trying to make
          your <br />
          design fit into a grid.

          New designers might feel confined by the idea of using a grid but you

          shouldn‚Äôt. After you‚Äôve created your grid, it‚Äôs ok to break it! But at

          you‚Äôre doing it intentionally and there are reasons for your design
          <br />
          decisions. The more you use a grid, the more you‚Äôll realize how it‚Äôs a

          Balancing whitespace or negative space is important in web design.
          <br />
          Don‚Äôt feel the need to fill every corner on a landing page design.
          Consider <br />
          large margins and healthy spacing between sections of content to allow
          <br />
          your user to breathe and pause as they are scrolling through your

          TRY USING WITH DIFFRENT 960 GRID <br />
          SYSTEM
        </h1>
        <p>
          The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development <br />
          workflow by providing commonly used dimensions based on a width of
          <br />
          960 pixels. There are two variations: 12 and 16 columns.
        </p>
        <p>The 960 grid follows the following structure:</p>
        <ul class="listed-info">
          <li>The total width is 960px</li>
          <li>Use 12 columns maximum, 60px each wide</li>
          <li>
            Use 10px spacing to the left and right of each column for a total
            gutter <br />
            spacing of 20px
          </li>
          <li>Total content area is 940px</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The 12-column grid system allows for plenty of flexibility. Here‚Äôs an
          <br />
          example of how you can use the 12 column grid to add content in a 3
          <br />

          social media, pay attention to the underlying grid. What kind of grid
